  <h1 class="heading">Stages of Rebuilding</h1>
  <h2>Our plan divides reconstruction into three phases that focus on both the short term and long term. </h2>
  <h2>Phase one will focus on Ukraine’s immediate needs to help to maintain Ukrainian infrastructure. 
  </h2>
  <h2>We will invest $1 billion towards one billion meals which should sustain 1,850,000 people for 6 months.
We will invest $505 million in medical supplies by sending trained professionals, creating free clinics, and providing supplies to Ukraine because about 14.5 million people need healthcare assistance. We will invest $1.5 billion for displaced families. That will give 750,000 tents and other shelters, 100 million hygiene packs and sets of clothes, and a communication network to families that need it. </h2>

  <h2>In the second phase that will take place after the end of the war, we will invest the rest of the money in our overall goal, helping Ukraine succeed in the long term by physically rebuilding the country with emphasis placed on transportation, shelter, and getting refugees back into the country. </h2>
  <h2>We will invest $3.5 billion towards fixing 2,700 apartments to shelter 540,000 people. We will also help fix the roads of Ukraine by giving $50 million. We can help families who fled the countries and want to come back by giving $500 million towards that. This will help find shelter, help students catch up on school work, updating their legal identification, accessing previous finances, and helping them find jobs. For Ukraine’s healthcare in the future, we want to invest $1 billion to build 25 hospitals as well as giving them start-up money to expedite the process. </h2>

  <h2>The final phase focuses on larger scale efforts like supporting future generations though healthcare and education. </h2>
  <h2> We plan to give $1.5 billion to start back up the education system as we believe students should have free education which is protected by the Ukrainian Constitution. Finally, we plan to give the rest of the money or $250 million towards healthcare once again to solidify Ukraine’s health is being treated and to support the national mental health due to the consequences of the war.
