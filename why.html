  <h1 class="heading">Why should we help Ukraine</h1>
  <h3>With the amount of damage that has occurred due to Russia's actions the people of Ukraine are in desperate need of aid. Any money given to us will not only be used to help Ukrainians during the war, but will also be used in the future to restore the country to its former state. Helping Ukraine will not only benefit the Ukranians, but will also aid the USA. Giving Ukraine humanitarian aid will boost morale, and support the people to ensure that they can regain control of their country back from Russia. When Ukraine is once again thriving, the world economy will improve, there will be less food shortages in Europe, and the USA will get recompense for being on the winning side of a war. 
</h3>
