  <h1 class="heading">Why should we help Ukraine</h1>
  <h3>Ukraine has suffered immensely throughout the war. Many innocent civilians have been injured or have been killed at the hands of Russian soldiers, many roads have been destroyed,  and many buildings and homes have been destroyed as well. These are facts that even some Russian soldiers can’t deny. When Russian soldiers were making unauthorized phone calls to their families and other loves ones, one, Sergey, a Russian soldier said to his mother, “F*ck. There are corpses just lying around on the road. Civilians are just lying around. It’s f*cked up”. With all this damage, the people need help. They need medical supplies, as many of theirs were used or destroyed. This includes at least 400 healthcare institutions that were destroyed according to the Ukrainian President Zelensky. They also need help rebuilding. Fighting a war is one thing, but if the money is sent to get more weapons to Ukraine, it will only work for the short term. If we want to help Ukraine, we need to help them for the long term. That means helping them survive for now and when the time comes, rebuilding their roads and infrastructure as well as helping their education so in the future, they can thrive once again.</h3>
<h3>
Another reason we should help Ukraine is to help is to help it thrive once again and to help the world economy. According to Reuters, there is a 58.5% increase in food prices mainly due to the war. Though Ukraine doesn’t seem to contribute much, according to the UN FAO, Ukraine exports  10% of the world’s wheat, 15% of the maize, 13% of the barley, 31% of the sunflower oil, and 61% of sunflower cake. That's 6% of all traded food calories. This has led to the food shortage in Europe. According to Forbes, the war has damaged $4.3 billion of Ukraine’s agriculture including $2.1 billion worth of farmland. If we want this to stop, we need to help Ukraine rebuild their agriculture and infrastructure. This will help world trade and benefit our economies. </h3>
<h3>
America can benefit from more than just economic aid. In the past, America was able to help countries and nations after a war and help their economy as well so they were able to be profitable again. An example of this post-WWII. The war left devastated countries in Western Europe as well as Japan with many buildings destroyed and many deaths in those countries. It made them no longer essential to the economy which meant they had to really rebuild themselves. However, America gave financial aid to the countries investing $18 billion in today’s money to just Japan alone. They also aided in rebuilding the countries’ economies so they are able to get back on their feet. Today, those countries are now part of the economy and are thriving. Japan is now the world’s third largest economy and are very important allies and trading partners with America. </h3>
