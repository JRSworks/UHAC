  <h3>Though Ukraine is fighting off Russia from many of its cities, its economy is in danger and will continue to be even after the war ends. With buildings and banks destroyed, fields and livestock gone, Ukraine will need some help to get back on its feet to be stable again and help provide to the world. The Ukrainian Humanitarian Aid Commision (UHAC) is dedicated to providing humanitarian aid for the people and the country of Ukraine. Our three-phase plan consists of providing immediate aid for people in need by providing food and medicine, aiding reconstruction, and providing long term aid by rebuilding infrastructure in the country. We have 10 billion dollars to work with, and we have planned out our expenses so that no money will be wasted. </h3>
